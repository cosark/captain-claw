"""Topic auto-replies for Gmail — the classifier and the judge.

Two unattended decisions, both made FD-side with the OWNER's own checkers,
never with the agent that writes the reply:

* :func:`classify` — is this inbound email about exactly one of the owner's
  enabled topics, and nothing else? :func:`classify_single` asks the same about
  one topic alone (the breadth test, so another topic can't mask its reach);
* :func:`judge` — the L2 semantic check of a reply that already passed the
  deterministic L1 guard (``captain_claw.outbound_guard``).

Each runs on **Jev** when the owner connected it (one ``ask_for_owner`` call of
typed questions with calibrated probabilities) and otherwise — or when Jev
fails — on the owner's Library tiers, walked here one at a time
(:func:`_ask_tiers`): ``balanced`` then ``reason`` for the classifier,
``reason`` then ``balanced`` for the judge, never ``micro`` or ``fast``,
temperature 0, one strict JSON object. A tier whose call fails or times out,
or whose answer is truncated, empty or unreadable, hands over to the next one
(a tier on a model already asked is skipped); a READABLE answer is final, pass
or fail — a refusal is never re-asked elsewhere. :func:`resolve_classifier` /
:func:`resolve_judge` say which checker an owner would get (enable
preconditions 7 and 8, the status line).

Prompt framing: the owner's topics are trusted, the email and the reply are
not. Untrusted text goes between ``<<<EMAIL n>>>`` / ``<<<REPLY n>>>`` and
``<<<END n>>>`` markers whose ``n`` is a fresh 16-hex nonce per call, and every
``<<<`` / ``>>>`` inside owner or inbound text becomes ``‹‹‹`` / ``›››``
(:func:`neutralise_markers`), so no text can close a block early. The sender
is named by address only (never the display name), and that address is
sender-chosen text like the rest: it sits INSIDE the email block, never in the
trusted framing, and only a plain ``local@domain`` (:func:`plain_address`) is
shown at all — an email whose From holds a quoted or otherwise unusual
address is ``from_not_plain`` before any checker runs. The topic brief never
reaches the classifier.

Nothing here raises (cancellation aside). A classifier that can't answer is
``Match(reason=CLASSIFIER_UNAVAILABLE)`` — the engine requeues the row; a
judge that can't answer is ``JudgeResult(unavailable=True)`` — the reply is
held for the owner (by then both tiers, and Jev, were tried). Every model call
is logged to ``usage_logs`` (``gmail_autoreply``: stage, source, model, tokens,
ok) with no content; a provider's error text, which can echo the request, is
never logged or returned — only its status.
